# Spring Framework Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Spring Framework Learning Repository**! 🚀

I have started learning the **Spring Framework** and continuously update this repository with my progress. This repository serves as a structured learning journal where I implement various concepts of Spring. My goal is to strengthen my expertise in **Java Development** and become **job-ready** for a **Java Software Engineer role**.

## 📁 Repository Structure
The key programs and implementations are organized within the following path:

```
spring-core/src/main/java/
```

Here, you will find the source code for my Spring Framework learning modules. I follow best practices to write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.

## 📌 How to Access the Programs
To explore my Spring Framework implementations:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Spring-Framework.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Spring-Framework
   ```
3. Open the project in your favorite IDE (**IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse**, or **VS Code**).
4. Locate the main programs inside:
   ```sh
   spring-core/src/main/java/
   ```
5. Run the programs and explore different Spring concepts.

## 💡 Why This Repository?
This repository showcases my **hands-on experience with the Spring Framework**, which is essential for backend development in Java. By maintaining this structured learning repository, I aim to demonstrate my proficiency in:
- **Spring Core**
- **Dependency Injection**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring MVC**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **RESTful Web Services**

This will help recruiters and hiring managers assess my **Java development skills** and **problem-solving abilities** in real-world applications.
