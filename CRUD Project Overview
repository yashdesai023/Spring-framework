# Student Management System (CRUD Application)

Welcome to the **Student Management System**, a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project built using **Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL**. This project demonstrates my ability to develop a complete backend system with database integration, showcasing my software engineering skills to recruiters and potential employers.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is designed to manage student records efficiently. It provides functionalities to:
- **Create** a new student record.
- **Read** and list all students.
- **Update** student details.
- **Delete** a student record.

The project follows the **MVC architecture**, ensuring maintainability and scalability. It integrates **Spring Boot for backend logic, Hibernate for ORM, and MySQL for persistent storage**.

## 📌 Features
✅ User-friendly CRUD operations.<br>
✅ Hibernate ORM for database interaction.<br>
✅ Spring Boot for seamless application development.<br>
✅ RESTful API endpoints for easy integration.<br>
✅ MySQL database for data storage.<br>
✅ Exception handling and validation.<br>

## 🔧 Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java 17+**
- **Maven**
- **MySQL Server**
- **Spring Boot CLI (Optional)**

### Steps to Run Locally
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-management-system.git
   cd student-management-system
   ```
2. **Configure Database**:
   - Open MySQL and create a database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE student_db;
     ```
   - Update `application.properties` with your MySQL credentials:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/student_db
     spring.datasource.username=root
     spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
     spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
     spring.jpa.show-sql=true
     ```
3. **Build and Run the application**:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
4. **Access the application**:
   - The API will be available at: `http://localhost:8080`
   - You can test API endpoints using **Postman** or **Swagger UI**.

## 📌 API Endpoints

| HTTP Method | Endpoint         | Description |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| GET        | /students       | Get all students |
| GET        | /students/{id}  | Get student by ID |
| POST       | /students       | Add a new student |
| PUT        | /students/{id}  | Update student details |
| DELETE     | /students/{id}  | Delete a student |
